  Shameless plug for C. Until Unicode is verifiably safely implemented at a low enough level,
  disable unicode. 7-bit ASCII only. One way is to swap the existing calls to the lowest-level
  API with something that NOPs. The second way is having the source for every program on your
  computer and removing or fixing their implementations. One of these days I'll enable it,
  but you can do absolute black magic with unicode. It's friggen cool to use as an exploit
  mechanism, but I don't want it running on my everyday system.

  # PS: Hanging on to magic string that does this. Definitely don't email me your PGP key for
  # requests for it. It's really neat and I wish I could, but I fear this one. It will be up
  # as soon as *recompiles <strong>everything from source*</strong>. Probably released
  simultaneously with write-up when I get around to debugging this.

Exactly how low-level it is:

  As an example (this is a consistent fail within a c++ program, so this is in the compiler/
  implementation of language itself). These are the lowest level I've found this exploit and
  I've seen it crash things like Qt5 - so at the application/library level instead of language:
